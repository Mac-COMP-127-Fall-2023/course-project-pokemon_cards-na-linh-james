# API 

## Start Menu
The game begins with the player being sent to a StartMenu where difficulty levels will be chosen with buttons. These levels will determine the number of cards/ pairs, as well as the number of permitted attempts and the time limit. 

## Gameplay 
Once chosen, the canvas will be replaced with the card grid, where the player must match all the cards in the alloted time and number of attempts. 

## Buttons
Three buttons will also appear on this screen. The pause button allows for the user to stop the game without affecting the timer and attempts, the start over button will allow for the canvas to be reset with those current difficulty level conditions, and the home button will send the user to the start menu. 

## Endgame

Assuming none of the buttons are clicked, the game ends depending on two different scenarios- win or lose. The player wins when all pairs are matched under the existing limits and no cards exist on the screen. If this happens, a victory image will appear. The player loses when the timer runs out or attempts limit is reached while cards still exist on the screen. In this case, a lose image will appear.

In both scenarios, a button will appear that, when clicked, will prompt two options: to retry the game with the same difficulty conditions or to be sent back to the home screen to choose a new difficulty.
